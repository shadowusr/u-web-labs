### Shadow Web Labs ###
This repository contains a small project that I wrote for my university. This was a quick one, so there're a lot of things to be improved. And yes. CSS code quality is absolutely awful, but it just works. Some day this can be fixed. Some day.

Live demo: https://shadow-web-labs.herokuapp.com

### Local installation ###
To install and launch this app locally run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/shadowusr/u-web-labs.git &&
cd u-web-labs &&
docker-compose up -d
```
Git and Docker Composed are required. The app will be launched on `localhost:1212`, but you can alter this address in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

By the way, this project entirely lacks i18n. I doubt it's needed though. I doubt that these lines will be ever read by someone.
